## ❓ Why This Project?

As an older brother, I want my siblings to always stay on track and continue growing, but spending hours teaching them is very time-consuming. So, I built FamilyConnect—an AI-powered online hub for family learning and productivity.

FamilyConnect allows AI to **generate, assign, and evaluate** tasks automatically, keeping everyone engaged in meaningful daily learning. It’s a **personalized AI-driven mentor** that tracks progress, maintains streaks, and fosters healthy learning habits.  

Unlike public educational platforms, this is a **closed system designed exclusively for family members**, ensuring a **safe, distraction-free, and collaborative environment** for education and self-improvement.
